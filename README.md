# applied_text_mining_in_python


This repository contains my weekly individual solutions on Jupyter Notebook for weekly programming assignments for [Applied Text Mining in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-text-mining?) course that is offered by [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org). Make sure to read the readme files before examining my answers. Readme files in each assignment display questions posed for the respective assignments.

Assignment 4 is considered to be a small project where I am required to model topics in `newsgroup_data` with [LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)] (ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation) model and implement the semantic text similarity analysis by examining different sets of text documents.
